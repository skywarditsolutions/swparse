Currently, 4i provides support for models' Participation Agreements and their associated Amendments, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-Covered Data Disclosure Forms, Data Sharing Agreements, and Novation Agreements.\\n\\nThis tip sheet provides a general overview of 4i's agreement management functionality, including highlights on accessing, signing, and downloading an entity/practice's agreements.\\n\\n# **\\\"My Agreements\\\"**\\n\\n4i users can navigate to their agreements by selecting the \\\"My Agreements\\\" tab from the leftside navigation pane. You must select the accurate \\\"Performance Year\\\" from the drop-down menu located at the top right portion of the \\\"My Agreements\\\" page.\\n\\nTo further filter the page and only display agreements in a specific signing status, you can select the agreement type from the \\\"Agreement Type\\\" drop-down (including \\\"All Agreements,\\\" \\\"Participation Agreement,\\\" \\\"Participation Agreement Amendment,\\\" \\\"Amended & Restated PA,\\\" and \\\"HIPAA\\\") and the applicable status from the \\\"Signature Status\\\" (including \\\"All Signature Status,\\\" \\\"Active,\\\" \\\"Pending APM Signature,\\\" \\\"Pending CMS Signature,\\\" \\\"Closed,\\\" \\\"Retired,\\\" \\\"Expired,\\\" and \\\"Terminated\\\") drop-down.\\n\\nYou can also access all agreement types in one view for each entity/practice by filtering the page to \\\"All Agreements\\\" and \\\"All Signature Status\\\" from the \\\"Agreement Type\\\" and \\\"Agreement Status\\\" drop-downs, respectively.

Once signed and fully executed, the Amended & Restated Participation Agreement retires any previously signed Participation Agreement(s) by the entity/practice.\\n\\n### **Who can sign Amended & Restated Participation Agreements in 4i?**\\n\\nTo sign an Amended & Restated Participation Agreement, you must be the entity's APM Executive or Practice's Primary Contact. The agreement signing window must also be open before you can sign. Follow each step below to sign your entity/practice's Amended & Restated Participation Agreement.\\n\\n- 1. Once the applicable Performance Year is selected, you must filter the \\\"Agreement Type\\\" and \\\"Signature Status\\\" drop-downs by \\\"Amended & Restated Participation Agreement\\\" and \\\"Pending APM Signature\\\" or \\\"Pending Practice Signature,\\\" respectively.\\n- 2. Repeat Steps 2 through 4 above (under Who can sign Participation Agreements in 4i?).\\n\\n**Note:** A fully executed Amended & Restated Participation Agreement will retire any previously signed Participation Agreement and any associated agreements, including any Participation Agreement Amendments. This means that upon CMS successfully countersigning the Amended & Restated Participation Agreement, your entity/practice's current Participation Agreement will be moved to a \\\"Retired\\\" status, and the newly signed agreement will become \\\"Active.\\\"\\n\\n### **Downloading Participation Agreement(s)/Participation Agreement Amendment(s)/Amended & Restated Participation Agreement(s)**\\n\\nAll agreements can be downloaded from the \\\"My Agreements\\\" page by users with access.

Otherwise, the status of the HIPAA Form will be updated to \\\"Pending Parent Form\\\" and will only update to \\\"Active\\\" when the associated Participation Agreement (Amendment) is countersigned by CMS.\\n\\nTo find the signed form, choose \\\"HIPAA-Covered Data Disclosure Form\\\" from the \\\"Agreement Type\\\" and \\\"Active\\\" from the \\\"Agreement Status\\\" drop-down filters.\\n\\n### **Updating the HIPAA-Covered Data Disclosure Form**\\n\\nIf the HIPAA-Covered Data Disclosure Form needs to be updated due to changes to your entity's/practice's data custodian details or other information, an updated form must be signed. Please follow the steps below to update your HIPAA form.\\n\\n- 1. Select \\\"HIPAA-Covered Data Disclosure Form\\\" and \\\"Active\\\" options from the \\\"Agreement Type\\\" and \\\"Agreement Status\\\" filters, respectively.\\n- 2. Select the Review (eye) icon under the \\\"Actions\\\" column.\\n- 3. The page will load the previously signed HIPAA form and you can select the \\\"Update HIPAA Disclosure Form\\\" button at the top right portion of the page. A pop-up modal containing a warning message will display on the screen to confirm if you would like to proceed with revising your HIPAA-Covered Data Disclosure Form. Selecting \\\"Yes\\\" will allow you to update and sign an updated HIPAA form.\\n- 4. Follow Steps 5 and 6 above (under Who can sign a HIPAA-Covered Data Disclosure Form in 4i?) to complete and sign the form.\\n\\n**Note:** You can revise your entity/practice's HIPAA form as many times as you wish. Whenever your entity's HIPAA form is revised, any previously signed HIPAA will be captured under the \\\"Retired\\\" category.\\n\\n### **Downloading the HIPAA-Covered Data Disclosure Form**\\n\\nTo download a copy of an executed HIPAA form, please follow the steps below.\\n\\n- 1. Select \\\"HIPAA Form\\\" and \\\"Active\\\" options from the \\\"Agreement Type\\\" and \\\"Agreement Status\\\" filters, respectively.\\n- 2. Select the \\\"Download\\\" (cloud) icon under the \\\"Actions\\\" column to download the fully executed agreement as a PDF file.\\n\\n**Note:** Only versions of agreements that were fully executed in the 4i application will be downloadable (i.e., in \\\"Active\\\" status). If a version of your form was migrated from another system, you will get a message that you are unable to download the form.\\n\\n![](_page_8_Picture_1.png)\\n\\n# **Novation Agreement**\\n\\nIf an entity or practice wants to transfer ownership to another corporation, CMS will be notified of this change and a Novation Agreement may be required so that all legal responsibilities and obligations can be successfully transferred. To be considered fully executed, the Novation Agreement will need to be tri-laterally signed by three parties, including the Transferor, Transferee, and CMS.\\n\\n## **Who can sign the Novation Agreement?**\\n\\nTo sign a Novation Agreement, you must have the role of APM Executive or Practice Primary Contact. The transferee, if not already in 4i, will need to be invited as a user to complete their required portion of the agreement and can only sign after the Transferor has completed their portion. Upon the Transferee signing the entity/practice's Novation Agreement, the status of the agreement will change to \\\"Pending CMS Signature.\\\" This status is an indicator that the agreement has been signed by both preceding parties and is now awaiting CMS' review and countersignature. The Novation Agreement will not be considered \\\"Active\\\" or \\\"Fully Executed\\\" until CMS has reviewed and countersigned the agreement.\\n\\n## **Signing the Novation Agreement as a Transferor**\\n\\nIn all cases, the transferring entity's APM Executive or Practice's Primary Contact may be required to sign the Novation Agreement on behalf of their entity or practice as the Transferor. This indicates that the transferring entity or practice legally agrees to release all rights and responsibilities to the new corporation. To sign the Novation Agreement as the Transferor, follow the steps below:\\n\\n- 1. Once the applicable Performance Year is selected, filter the \\\"Agreement Type\\\" to \\\"Novation Agreement\\\" and the \\\"Signature Status\\\" to \\\"Pending APM Signature\\\" or \\\"Pending Practice Signature,\\\" respectively. Upon filtering the page, the Novation Agreement will display the \\\"Sign\\\" (pencil) icon under the \\\"Actions\\\" column for each entity or practice with which you are associated.\\n- 2. Selecting the enabled \\\"Sign\\\" (pencil) icon under the \\\"Actions\\\" column will open the Novation Agreement page, displaying the recital and signature details.\\n- 3. After reviewing all details on the page, scroll to the attestation checkbox at the bottom of the displayed agreement to sign on behalf of the entity/practice as the APM Executive or Practice's Primary Contact.\\n- 4. Proceed by selecting the \\\"Sign\\\" button at the bottom of the page. After signing, a confirmation message will be displayed on the screen, indicating that you have signed the Novation Agreement on behalf of your entity/practice.\\n\\n**Note:** The Novation Agreement will remain in \\\"Pending APM Signature\\\" or \\\"Pending Practice Signature\\\" status after you have signed the Novation Agreement. After the Transferee has signed the agreement, the status will change to \\\"Pending CMS Signature.\\\"\\n\\n![](_page_9_Picture_1.png)\\n\\n# **Signing the Novation Agreement as a Transferee**\\n\\nAfter the Transferor has signed the Novation Agreement, the Transferee will be required to sign the Novation Agreement. If the Transferee is not a 4i user, CMS will extend an invitation to the Transferee, which will allow minimal access to 4i after the invitation is accepted. To sign the Novation Agreement as a Transferee, repeat steps 1-4 outlined above (under the Signing the Novation Agreement as a Transferor section). Once the Novation Agreement is countersigned by CMS, all restrictions will be removed and privileges to the application will be elevated (Contact Type will be elevated from Transferee to APM Executive). Access to PHI will be restricted until a new HIPAA-Covered Data Disclosure Form is signed.\\n\\nSince the Novation Agreement is required to be countersigned before it is considered \\\"Active,\\\" the CMS Executive user will be required to complete the signature process.\\n\\n# **4i's Agreement Signature Status Definitions**\\n\\n| Signature | Definitions |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Status |  |\\n| Active | This signature status describes agreements that have completed the |\\n|  | execution of its signature workflow. This signature status will be |\\n|  | applicable for ALL agreement types. |\\n| Pending APM | This signature status describes agreements that require an APM |\\n| or Practice | Executive's or Practice Primary Contact's signature. |\\n| Signature | Once an agreement is delivered to the model participant, this signature |\\n|  | status will indicate an action to be completed by the entity or practice's |\\n|  | APM Executive user or Practice Primary contact. |\\n| Pending CMS | This signature status describes agreements that require a CMS |\\n| Signature | Executive's signature. |\\n|  | An agreement type will be considered legally executed and will carry an |\\n|  | \\\"Active\\\" status, only after CMS has counter-signed the agreement. |\\n|  | This status will apply to all agreement types, except the HIPAA Covered |\\n|  | Data Disclosure Form as CMS is not required to countersign this |\\n|  | agreement. |\\n| Closed | This signature status describes agreement types that have never |\\n|  | completed the execution of the agreement's signature workflow. These |\\n|  | agreements were never active at any point. Example use cases for this |\\n|  | status are: |\\n|  | i. An entity does not sign any of the agreement types after the |\\n|  | signing window has closed. |\\n|  | ii. CMS declines to countersign the agreement. |\\n\\n![](_page_10_Picture_0.png)\\n\\n**Support** \\n\\nIf you have questions or require technical assistance, please see the contact information below. **Email:** \\n\\n- **PCF Model:** PCFTechnicalSupport@cms.hhs.gov\\n- **ACO REACH Model:** ACOREACH@cms.hhs.gov\\n- **KCC Model:** KCF-CKCC-CMMI@cms.hhs.gov\\n\\n#### **Phone:**\\n\\nCall **1-888-734-6433** and then select one of the following:\\n\\n- **PCF**  option 4\\n- **ACO REACH** option 1, and then option 1 again\\n- KCC option 1, and then option 3\\n\\n\"\n",
