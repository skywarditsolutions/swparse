The price in these transactions generally provides the best indication of the\nenterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by\nusing other valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market\ndata of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee\u2019s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in\nthis valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections.\n      Once the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (\u201cOPM\u201d), a common stock equivalent (\u201cCSE\u201d) method or a hybrid approach is\nemployed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us.

The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market data of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee\u2019s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in this valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections.\n\nOnce the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (\u201cOPM\u201d), a common stock equivalent (\u201cCSE\u201d) method or a hybrid approach is employed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model involves making assumptions around the investee\u2019s expected time to liquidity and volatility.\n\nAn increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, could result in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and volatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee\u2019s financing transactions. In the future, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value.\n\nWe determine realized gains or losses on the sale of equity on a specific identification method.", "bBox": {"x": 17, "y": 100, "w": 562.61, "h": 498.56}}, {"type": "heading", "lvl": 1, "value": "Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value Using Level 3 Inputs", "md": "# Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value Using Level 3 Inputs", "bBox": {"x": 18, "y": 110, "w": 505.09, "h": 400.56}}, {"type": "text", "value": "The following table presents a reconciliation of our financial assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2022, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in millions):", "md": "The following table presents a reconciliation of our financial assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2022, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in millions):", "bBox": {"x": 17, "y": 87, "w": 561.7, "h": 449.56}}, {"type": "table", "rows": [["", "Non-marketable Equity Securities", "", "Note Receivables", "", "", "MLU B.V.

\u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Information\n      We determine our operating segments based on how the chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) manages the business, allocates resources, makes operating\ndecisions and evaluates operating performance.\n      As of the first quarter of 2022, our three operating and reportable segments are as follows:\n      Segment                             Description\n      Mobility                            Mobility products connect consumers with Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws,\n                                          motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our Financial Partnerships and Transit offerings.\n      Delivery                            Delivery offerings allow consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or\n                                          have the meal delivered. In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as\n                                          well as select other goods.\n      Freight                             Freight connects carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a\n                                          shipment. Freight also includes transportation management and other logistics services offerings.\n      For information about how our reportable segments derive revenue, refer to Note 2 \u2013 Revenue. Our segment operating performance measure is segment\nadjusted EBITDA. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset information and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by segment.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA is defined as revenue less the following expenses: cost of revenue, operations and support, sales and marketing, and general and\nadministrative and research and development expenses associated with our segments. Segment adjusted EBITDA also excludes non-cash items or items that\nmanagement does not believe are reflective of our ongoing core operations (as shown in the table below). The following table provides information about our\nsegments and a reconciliation of the total segment adjusted EBITDA to loss from operations (in millions):\n                                                                                                                                                                     Three Months Ended March 31,\n                                                                                                                                                                       2021                      2022\nSegment adjusted EBITDA:\n  Mobility                                                                                                                                                   $                  298     $               618\n  Delivery                                                                                                                                                                    (200)                       30\n  Freight                                                                                                                                                                       (29)                       2\n  All Other                                                                                                                                                                     (11)                      \u2014\nTotal segment adjusted EBITDA                                                                                                                                                    58                     650\nReconciling items:Corporate G&A and Platform R&D(1), (2)                                                                                                                      (417)                    (482)\n  Depreciation and amortization                                                                                                                                               (212)                    (254)\n  Stock-based compensation expense                                                                                                                                            (281)                    (359)\n  Legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements                                                                                                                  (551)                       \u2014\n  Goodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets                                                                                                                         (57)                     (13)\n  Acquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses                                                                                                                      (36)                     (14)\n  Accelerated lease costs related to cease-use of ROU assets                                                                                                                     (2)                      \u2014\n  COVID-19 response initiatives                                                                                                                                                 (26)                      (1)\n  Loss on lease arrangements, net                                                                                                                                                \u2014                        (7)\n  Restructuring and related charges                                                                                                                                              \u2014                        (2)\nLoss from operations                                                                                                                                         $              (1,524)     $              (482)\n\n      (1)Excluding stock-based compensation expense.\n      (2)Includes costs that are not directly attributable to our reportable segments.

Damages include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage, which will be assessed and quantified at a future hearing in July 2022.\n      On March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 Mobility drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage\nwhen driving with Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a\nsettlement process with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law. Our portal for drivers to register for a\nsettlement of historical holiday pay and national minimum wage liabilities closed on July 22, 2021 and we have extended offers to all drivers eligible for settlement\nwho are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers. Compensation hearings will take place in 2022 for\nclaimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time, expenses, and holiday pay.\n      On June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation. We have completed the\nenrollment of eligible drivers in the UK into a pension plan.

The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the Alameda County Superior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California Court of Appeal and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization, who intervened in the matter, has also filed an appeal.\n\n# Massachusetts Attorney General Lawsuit\n\nOn July 9, 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint in Suffolk County Superior Court against Uber and Lyft. The complaint alleges Drivers are employees, and are entitled to protections under the wage and labor laws. The complaint was served on July 20, 2020 and Uber filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on September 24, 2020, which was denied on March 25, 2021. A summary judgment motion was filed in September 2021, and we filed a motion in which we argue that the motion is premature.

We are challenging each of them before the Social Security and Administrative Tribunals. In April 2021, a ruling was made that Uber Switzerland could not be held liable for social security contributions. The litigations with regards to Uber B.V. and Raiser Operations B.V. are still pending for years 2014 to 2019. In January 2022, the Social Security Tribunal of Zurich reclassified drivers who have used the App in 2014 as dependent workers of Uber BV and Rasier Operations BV from a social security standpoint, but this ruling has been appealed before the Federal Tribunal and has no impact on our current operations. A ruling on the merits by the Federal Tribunal is expected in 2023. The ultimate resolution of the matters appealed before the Federal Tribunal is uncertain and the amount accrued for those matters is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2022.\n\n# Aslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., Uber Britannia Ltd. and Uber London Ltd.\n\nOn October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the UK Employment Tribunal against us asserting that they should be classified as \u201cworkers\u201d (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors. The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that Drivers were workers whenever our App is switched on and they are ready and able to take trips based on an assessment of the App in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018.

Levandowski\n      On October 28, 2016, Google filed arbitration demands against each of Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron, former employees of Google, alleging breach of\ntheir respective employment agreements with Google, fraud and other state law violations (due to soliciting Google employees and starting a new venture to\ncompete with Google\u2019s business in contravention of their respective employment agreements). Google sought damages, injunctive relief, and restitution. On March\n26, 2019, following a hearing, the arbitration panel issued an interim award, finding against each of Google\u2019s former employees and awarding $127 million against\nAnthony Levandowski and $1 million for which both Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron are jointly and severally liable. In July 2019, Google submitted its\nrequest for interest, attorneys fees, and costs related to these claims. The Panel\u2019s Final Award was issued on December 6, 2019. On February 7, 2020, Ron and\nGoogle entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release to satisfy the corrected final award in the amount of approximately $10 million. Uber paid Google\non behalf of Ron pursuant to an indemnification obligation. A dispute continues to exist with regard to Uber\u2019s alleged indemnification obligation to Levandowski.\nWhether Uber is ultimately responsible for indemnification of Levandowski depends on the exceptions and conditions set forth in the indemnification agreement.\nIn March 2020, Levandowski pleaded guilty to criminal trade secret charges and filed for bankruptcy. Former President Trump pardoned Levandowski from the\ntrade secret conviction. Uber filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court, and Levandowski additionally asserted a claim against Uber alleging that Uber failed to\nperform its obligations under an agreement with Otto Trucking, LLC. For these claims, Uber and Levandowski reached a confidential settlement, which was\nformally approved by the court on May 2, 2022. The approval of the settlement and confirmation of Levandowski\u2019s bankruptcy plan is subject to appeal by May\n16, 2022, by certain creditors and the taxing authorities.

The subject matter of these contingent liabilities and non-income tax audits primarily arises from our transactions with Drivers, as well as\nthe tax treatment of certain employee benefits and related employment taxes. In jurisdictions with disputes connected to transactions with Drivers, disputes involve\nthe applicability of transactional taxes (such as sales, value added and similar taxes) to services provided, as well as the applicability of withholding tax on\npayments made to such Drivers.\n      We are involved in a proceeding in the UK about our historic operating model in the UK involving HMRC, the tax regulator in the UK, which is seeking to\nclassify us as a transportation provider. Being classified as a transportation provider would result in a VAT (20%) on Gross Bookings or on the service fee that we\ncharge Drivers prior to March 14, 2022. HMRC is considering a number of factors including our contractual Driver, Rider and intercompany arrangements, and\nHMRC is also expected to consider the UK Supreme Court\u2019s February 19, 2021 ruling on Drivers\u2019 worker classification, in determining whether we should be\nclassified as a provider of transportation services. HMRC may update its assessment, which we would then review and discuss with HMRC. If we do not reach a\nsatisfactory resolution after exhausting HMRC\u2019s review and appeals process, we would still be able to argue our case anew in the UK Tax Court, which may\nrequire the up-front payment to the Tax Court (\u201cpay-to-play\u201d) of any final HMRC assessment to be held in escrow. We continue to believe that we have meritorious\ndefense in these proceedings. As of March 14, 2022, we modified our operating model in the UK, such that as of that date Uber UK is a merchant of transportation\nand is required to remit VAT on Gross Bookings, which we are remitting under the Value Added (Tour Operators) Order 1987. As part of our ongoing discussions\nwith HMRC we anticipate that they will review our VAT remittance as a merchant of transportation.\n      Our estimated liability is inherently subjective due to the complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial processes in certain jurisdictions,\ntherefore, the final outcome could be materially different from the estimated liability recorded.\n\n                                                                                                        29", "md": "supported by the law and intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.

HMRC may update its assessment, which we would then review and discuss with HMRC. If we do not reach a satisfactory resolution after exhausting HMRC\u2019s review and appeals process, we would still be able to argue our case anew in the UK Tax Court, which may require the up-front payment to the Tax Court (\u201cpay-to-play\u201d) of any final HMRC assessment to be held in escrow.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n      The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated\nfinancial statements included in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion\ncontains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-\nlooking statements. You should review the sections titled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of forward-looking statements\nand Part II, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the\nforward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n      Overview\n      We are a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to power movement from point A\nto point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform. We connect consumers with providers of\nride services, merchants as well as delivery service providers for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Uber also connects consumers with public\ntransportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight\nindustry. We are also developing technologies that provide new solutions to everyday problems.\n      Driver Classification Developments\n      The classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are\ninvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before\nadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as\nworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5,\n2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco\nSuperior Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft Inc., alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the\nalleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\n      On August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violating\nvarious wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply with\nthe preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use\nplatforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s\npreliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of\nProposition 22.\n      In January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional,\nwhich was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the Alameda County\nSuperior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California\nCourt of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization, who intervened in the matter, has also filed an appeal.\n      To comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings\nfloor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, results\nof operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n      Also of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) Employment\nTribunal against us asserting that they should be classified as \u201cworkers\u201d (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK rather\nthan independent contractors. The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our App is switched on and they are ready and able\nto take trips, based on an assessment of the App in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed\nto the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.\n      On February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling. Subsequently, we initiated a historical claims settlement process for UK\ndrivers. Damages may include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. You should review the sections titled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of forward-looking statements and Part II, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\n# Overview\n\nWe are a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform. We connect consumers with providers of ride services, merchants as well as delivery service providers for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. We are also developing technologies that provide new solutions to everyday problems.\n\n# Driver Classification Developments\n\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft Inc., alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\n\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violating various wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply with the preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of Proposition 22.\n\nIn January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional, which was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the Alameda County Superior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California Court of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization, who intervened in the matter, has also filed an appeal.\n\nTo comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings floor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\nAlso of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) Employment Tribunal against us asserting that they should be classified as \u201cworkers\u201d (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors. The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our App is switched on and they are ready and able to take trips, based on an assessment of the App in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.\n\nOn February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling. Subsequently, we initiated a historical claims settlement process for UK drivers. Damages may include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage. Additional claimants have also filed and each claimant will be required to bring their own separate action to an employment tribunal to determine whether they met the \u201cworker\u201d classification and if so, how much each claimant will be awarded.\n\nOn March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 Mobility drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when driving with Uber.

in Gross Bookings of 35%, or 39% on a constant currency basis, primarily\ndriven by increases in Mobility Trip volumes as the business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19, and a $1.5 billion increase in Freight revenue resulting\nprimarily from the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021.

Our calculation of these non-\nGAAP financial measures may differ from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our peer companies. These non-GAAP financial measures\nshould not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n      Adjusted EBITDA\n      We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding (i) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, (ii) net income (loss)\nattributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax, (iii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iv) income (loss) from equity method investments, (v) interest\nexpense, (vi) other income (expense), net, (vii) depreciation and amortization, (viii) stock-based compensation expense, (ix) certain legal, tax, and regulatory\nreserve changes and settlements, (x) goodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets, (xi) acquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses, (xii)\nrestructuring and related charges and (xiii) other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, including COVID-19 response initiatives related\npayments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver\nreimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and\nothers in need as well as charitable donations.\n      We have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q because it is a key measure used by our management team to evaluate our\noperating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses. Accordingly, we believe that\nAdjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our\nmanagement team and board of directors. In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of\ncertain non-cash expenses and certain variable charges. To help our board, management and investors assess the impact of COVID-19 on our results of operations,\nwe are excluding the impacts of COVID-19 response initiatives related payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of\npersonal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free\nrides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations from Adjusted EBITDA. Our board and management\nfind the exclusion of the impact of these COVID-19 response initiatives from Adjusted EBITDA to be useful because it allows us and our investors to assess the\nimpact of these response initiatives on our results of operations.\n      COVID-19 Response Initiatives\n      To support those whose earning opportunities have been depressed as a result of COVID-19, as well as communities hit hard by the pandemic, we have\nannounced and implemented several initiatives, including, in particular, payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of\npersonal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free\nrides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations. The payments for financial assistance to Drivers\npersonally impacted by COVID-19 and Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment are recorded as a reduction to revenue.\nThe cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need\nas well as charitable donations are recorded as an expense in our costs and expenses.\n      Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\n      Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a substitute for the related\nfinancial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. Our calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our peer companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n# Adjusted EBITDA\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding (i) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, (ii) net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax, (iii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iv) income (loss) from equity method investments, (v) interest expense, (vi) other income (expense), net, (vii) depreciation and amortization, (viii) stock-based compensation expense, (ix) certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements, (x) goodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets, (xi) acquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses, (xii) restructuring and related charges and (xiii) other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, including COVID-19 response initiatives related payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations.\n\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q because it is a key measure used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain non-cash expenses and certain variable charges. To help our board, management and investors assess the impact of COVID-19 on our results of operations, we are excluding the impacts of COVID-19 response initiatives related payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations from Adjusted EBITDA. Our board and management find the exclusion of the impact of these COVID-19 response initiatives from Adjusted EBITDA to be useful because it allows us and our investors to assess the impact of these response initiatives on our results of operations.\n\n# COVID-19 Response Initiatives\n\nTo support those whose earning opportunities have been depressed as a result of COVID-19, as well as communities hit hard by the pandemic, we have announced and implemented several initiatives, including, in particular, payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations. The payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19 and Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment are recorded as a reduction to revenue. The cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations are recorded as an expense in our costs and expenses.\n\n# Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\n\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These limitations include the following:\n\n- Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain recurring, non-cash charges, such as depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, and although these are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect all cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;", "images": [], "charts": [], "items": [{"type": "heading", "lvl": 1, "value": "Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures", "md": "# Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures", "bBox": {"x": 17, "y": 61, "w": 561.68, "h": 132.56}}, {"type": "text", "value": "We collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business and assess our performance.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n      We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency\nrisk as follows:\n      Interest Rate Risk\n      Our exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The\n2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact\nour condensed consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100\nbasis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\n      The fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining\nin periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $289 million\nas of March 31, 2022.\n      Investment Risk\n      Our investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cash\nequivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.8 billion and $7.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, respectively. We did\nnot have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of March 31, 2022. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market funds\nand cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk.\nChanges in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in\ninterest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\n      We are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and\nrecently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value\ngiven the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. These\ninvestments in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fair\nvalue of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of\ntime after a public offering. As of March 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investments was $6.9 billion, including equity method investments.\n      Foreign Currency Risk\n      We transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to\nthe risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating\nexpenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating\nresults as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified\nacross geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.\n      We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurement\nof our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currency\nrates may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter into\nderivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n      Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n      We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that we\nfile or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,\nincluding our Chief Executive\n\n                                                                                                         48", "md": "For additional information about our critical accounting policies and estimates, see the disclosure included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as Note 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\n# Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSee Note 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\n# ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk as follows:\n\n# Interest Rate Risk\n\nOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The 2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact our condensed consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\n\nThe fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $289 million as of March 31, 2022.\n\n# Investment Risk\n\nOur investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.8 billion and $7.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, respectively. We did not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of March 31, 2022. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market funds and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\n\nWe are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and recently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value given the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. These investments in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fair value of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. As of March 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investments was $6.9 billion, including equity method investments.\n\n# Foreign Currency Risk\n\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified across geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.\n\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurement of our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currency rates may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.\n\n# ITEM 4.

For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs have brought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees.\n\nIn November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of Proposition 22.

Further, some of our current or potential competitors have, and may in the future continue to have, greater resources and access to larger Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, or carrier bases in a particular geographic market. In addition, our competitors in certain geographic markets enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets, better localized knowledge, and more supportive regulatory regimes. As a result, such competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than us in such markets to new or changing opportunities, technologies, consumer preferences, regulations, or standards, which may render our products or offerings less attractive. In addition, future competitors may share in the effective benefit of any regulatory or governmental approvals and litigation victories we may achieve, without having to incur the costs we have incurred to obtain such benefits.\n\nWe are contractually restricted from competing with our minority-owned affiliates with respect to certain aspects of our business, including in China through August 2023, Russia/CIS through February 2025, Southeast Asia through the later of March 2023 or one year after we dispose of all interests in Grab, India with respect to meal delivery through January 2023, and the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and certain parts of Europe with respect to e-bikes and e-scooters through May 2023, while none of our minority-owned affiliates are restricted from competing with us anywhere in the world. Didi currently competes with us in certain countries in Latin America and in Australia. In addition, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture currently competes with us in certain countries in Europe and Africa. As Didi and our other minority-owned affiliates continue to expand their businesses, they may in the future compete with us in additional geographic markets. In addition, we are contractually restricted from competing with some of our majority-owned affiliates with respect to certain aspects of our business, including competing against Uber Freight with respect to freight brokerage.\n\nAdditionally, if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval of our acquisitions, we may not ultimately consummate such acquisitions or may consummate them only in jurisdictions where antitrust approval is obtained. Further, in order to obtain regulatory approval of acquisitions, we may be required to divest all or part of our or the target company\u2019s operations or agree to other remedies.

Additionally, we rely on pricing models to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings, which have been modified over time and will likely in the future be modified, and pricing models at times vary based upon jurisdiction. We cannot assure you that our pricing models or strategies will be successful in attracting consumers and Drivers. For example, changes we have made in California to the information that Drivers see in the application, as well as pricing and offer structure changes, adversely impacted usage of the application. If we are unable to successfully manage these and similar kinds of changes in the future, our business may be adversely impacted.\n\nThe markets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding sources, and we anticipate that many of our competitors will continue to be highly capitalized. Moreover, certain of our stockholders, including SoftBank (a large stockholder), have made substantial investments in certain of our competitors and may increase such investments, make new investments in other competitors, or enter into strategic transactions with competitors in the future. These investments or strategic transactions, along with other competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to compete more effectively against us and continue to lower their prices, offer Driver incentives or consumer discounts and promotions, or otherwise attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to their platform and away from ours. Such competitive pressures may lead us to maintain or lower fares or service fees or maintain or increase our Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. Ridesharing and certain other categories in which we compete are relatively nascent, and we cannot guarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to achieve profitability.\n\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increase significantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\n\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception. We incurred operating losses of $4.9 billion and $3.8 billion in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, and as of March 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $29.6 billion. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels and decrease proportionate expenses in future periods to achieve profitability in many of our largest markets, including in the United States, and even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability. We may continue to incur losses in the near term as a result of substantial increases in our operating expenses, as we continue to invest in order to: increase the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers using our platform through incentives, discounts, and promotions; expand within existing or into new markets; increase our research and development expenses; expand marketing channels and operations; hire additional employees; and add new products and offerings to our platform. These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these expenses. Many of our efforts to generate revenue are new and unproven, and any failure to adequately increase revenue or contain the related costs could prevent us from attaining or increasing profitability. In addition, we sometimes introduce new products that we expect to add value to our overall platform and network but which we expect will generate lower Gross Bookings per Trip or a lower Take Rate. Further, we charge a lower service fee to certain of our largest chain restaurant partners on our Delivery offering to grow the number of Delivery consumers, which may at times result in a negative take rate with respect to those transactions after considering amounts collected from consumers and paid to Drivers. As we expand our offerings to additional cities, our offerings in these cities may be less profitable than the markets in which we currently operate. As such, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the near term, in accordance with our expectations, or at all. Additionally, we may not realize the operating efficiencies we expect to achieve as a result of our acquisition of Careem and Postmates, and may continue to incur significant operating losses in the United States, Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan in the future. Even if we do experience operating efficiencies, our operating results may not improve, at least in the near term.\n\nIf we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users, and our financial results would be adversely impacted.\n\nOur success in a given geographic market significantly depends on our ability to maintain or increase our network scale and liquidity in that geographic market by attracting Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform. If Drivers choose not to offer their services through our platform, or elect to offer them through a competitor\u2019s platform, we may lack a sufficient supply of Drivers to attract consumers and merchants to our platform. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints in most geographic markets in which we operate, and such supply constraints have been and may continue to be impacted by concerns regarding the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. To the extent that we experience Driver supply constraints in a given market, we may need to increase or may not be able to reduce the Driver incentives that we offer without adversely affecting the liquidity network effect that we experience in that market. Similarly, if carriers choose not to offer their services through our platform or elect to use other freight brokers, we may lack a sufficient supply of carriers in specific geographic markets to attract shippers to our platform. Furthermore, if merchants choose to partner with other delivery services in a specific geographic market, or if merchants choose to engage exclusively with our competitors, other merchant marketing websites, or other delivery services, we may lack a sufficient variety and supply of restaurant and other merchant options, or lack access to the most popular restaurants, such that our Delivery offering will become less appealing to consumers and merchants.

We have previously received significant media coverage and\nnegative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain\nor enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.\n      Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract new employees and platform users, to preserve and deepen the\nengagement of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, government investigations, and adverse\nplatform user sentiment.\n      We have previously received a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which has adversely affected our brand and reputation and fueled\ndistrust of our company. Previous negative publicity, particularly as a result of cultural issues in 2017, adversely affected our brand and reputation, which made it\ndifficult for us to attract and retain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our products and offerings, invites continued legislative and regulatory scrutiny,\nand results in additional litigation and governmental investigations. Concurrently with and after these events, our competitors raised additional capital, increased\ntheir investments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.\n      In 2019, we released a safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed to have\noccurred on our platform in the United States. The continuing public responses to this safety report or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safety\nincidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, may continue\nto result in positive and negative media coverage and increased regulatory scrutiny and could adversely affect our reputation with platform users. Further\nunfavorable media coverage and negative publicity could adversely impact our financial results and future prospects. As our platform continues to scale and\nbecomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation could\nhave an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates and\nCornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harm\nto their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation.\n      Our brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control. For example, we have licensed our brand in connection with certain\ndivestitures and joint ventures, including to Didi in China, to our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, and to Zomato in India, and while we have certain\ncontractual protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions,\nand consumers may not be aware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Additionally, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we\nannounced that we are actively looking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining holdings in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. Furthermore, if Drivers,\nmerchants, or carriers provide diminished quality of service, are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the\nlaw, we may receive unfavorable press coverage and our reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result\nin harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.\n      While we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining a\ngood reputation, minimizing the number of safety incidents, continuing an improved culture and workplace practices, improving our compliance programs,\nmaintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, and\nmedia strategies have involved significant costs and may not be successful. We anticipate that other competitors and potential competitors will expand their\nofferings, which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive.

We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affect our operating results.\n\nAs our operations have expanded, we have grown from 159 employees as of December 31, 2012 to approximately 30,900 global employees as of March 31, 2022, of whom approximately 18,100 were located outside the United States. We expect the total number of our employees located outside the United States to increase as we expand globally. Properly managing our growth will require us to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and staff, including engineers, operations personnel, financial and accounting staff, and sales and marketing staff, and to improve and maintain our technology. If our new hires perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating new employees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees and staff, our business may be harmed. Moreover, in order to optimize our organizational structure, we have implemented several reductions in workforce and restructurings, including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, and may in the future implement other reductions in workforce. Any reduction in workforce or restructuring may yield unintended consequences and costs, such as attrition beyond the intended reduction in workforce, the distraction of employees, or reduced employee morale and could adversely affect our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficult for us to hire new employees in the future and increase the risk that we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the reduction in workforce. Properly managing our growth or any reductions in workforce will require us to establish consistent policies across regions and functions, and a failure to do so could likewise harm our business.\n\nOur failure to upgrade our technology or network infrastructure effectively to support our growth could result in unanticipated system disruptions, slow response times, or poor experiences for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers. To manage the growth of our operations and personnel and improve the technology that supports our business operations, as well as our financial and management systems, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal controls over financial reporting, we will be required to commit substantial financial, operational, and technical resources. In particular, we will need to improve our transaction processing and reporting, operational, and financial systems, procedures, and controls. For example, due to our significant growth, especially with respect to our high-growth emerging offerings like Delivery and Freight, we face challenges in timely and appropriately designing controls in response to evolving risks of material misstatement. These improvements are and will be particularly challenging when we acquire new businesses with different systems. Our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. If we are unable to expand our operations and hire additional qualified personnel in an efficient manner, or if our operational technology is insufficient to reliably service Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or carriers, platform user satisfaction will be adversely affected and may cause platform users to switch to our competitors\u2019 platforms, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nOur organizational structure is complex and will continue to grow as we add additional Drivers, consumers, merchants, carriers, shippers, employees, products and offerings, and technologies, and as we continue to expand globally. We will need to improve our operational, financial, and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures to support the growth of our organizational structure. We will require capital and management resources to grow and mature in these areas. If we are unable to effectively manage the growth of our business, the quality of our platform may suffer, and we may be unable to address competitive challenges, which would adversely affect our overall business, operations, and financial condition.\n\nIf platform users engage in, or are subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, our ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers may be harmed, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nWe are not able to control or predict the actions of platform users and third parties, either during their use of our platform or otherwise, and we may be unable to protect or provide a safe environment for Drivers and consumers as a result of certain actions by Drivers, consumers, merchants, carriers, and third parties. Such actions may result in injuries, property damage, or loss of life for consumers and third parties, or business interruption, brand and reputational damage, or significant liabilities for us. Although we administer certain qualification processes for users of our platform, including background checks on Drivers through third-party service providers, these qualification processes and background checks may not expose all potentially relevant information and are limited in certain jurisdictions according to national and local laws, and our third-party service providers may fail to conduct such background checks adequately or disclose information that could be relevant to a determination of eligibility.

In addition, the\ngrowth of our Delivery offering has led to an increase in Couriers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and bicycles, who are more vulnerable road users and\nface a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved or uneven\nroadways increase the risk and severity of potential injuries. In addition, Couriers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitan areas,\nneed to share, navigate, and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads occupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during \u201crush\u201d hours, all of\nwhich heighten the potential risk of injuries or death. Our auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover all potential claims to which we are\nexposed, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability. These incidents may subject us to liability and negative publicity, which would increase our\noperating costs and adversely affect our business, operating results, and future prospects.

As a result, a significant portion of our assets includes minority ownership positions, including in Didi, Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime, Zomato and Aurora.\n\nOur ownership in these entities involves significant risks that are outside our control. We are not represented on the management team or board of directors of Didi or Zomato, and therefore we do not participate in the day-to-day management of Didi or Zomato or the actions taken by the board of directors of Didi and Zomato. We are not represented on the management teams of Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime or Aurora, and therefore do not participate in the day-to-day management of Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime or Aurora. Although we are represented on each of the boards of directors of Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime and Aurora, we do not have a controlling influence on those boards. As a result, the boards of directors or management teams of these companies may make decisions or take actions with which we disagree or that may be harmful to the value of our ownership in these companies. Additionally, these companies have expanded their offerings, and we expect them to continue to expand their offerings in the future, to compete with us in various markets throughout the world. While this could enhance the value of our ownership interest in these companies, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects would be adversely affected by such expansion into markets in which we operate.\n\nAny material decline in the business of these entities would adversely affect the value of our assets and our financial results. Furthermore, the value of these assets is based in part on the market valuations of these entities, and weakened financial markets have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect such valuations. To the extent these businesses are or become publicly traded companies, volatility or fluctuations in the stock price of such companies could adversely impact our financial results. These positions could expose us to risks, litigation, and unknown liabilities because, among other things, these companies have limited operating histories in evolving industries and may have less predictable operating results; to the extent these companies are privately owned, limited public information is available and we may not learn all the material information regarding these businesses; are domiciled and operate in countries with particular economic, tax, political, legal, safety, regulatory and public health risks, including the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their business; are domiciled or operate in countries that may become subject to economic sanctions or foreign investment restrictions; depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of individuals, and, as a result, the death, disability, resignation, or termination of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect on the relevant company\u2019s operations; and will likely require substantial additional capital to support their operations and expansion and to maintain their competitive positions. For example, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, members of our management team resigned from the board of our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, and we announced that we are actively looking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining holdings in the joint venture. The broader consequences of this conflict, which may include additional international sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and geopolitical shifts, increased tensions between the United States and countries in which we operate, and the extent of the conflict\u2019s effect on the global economy, cannot be predicted. Any of these risks could materially affect the value of our assets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or the trading price of our common stock.\n\nFurther, we are contractually limited in our ability to sell or transfer these assets. For example, in connection with Aurora\u2019s November 2021 initial public offering, we are subject to a 4-year lock-up with respect to our shares in Aurora. Other than Aurora, Grab, Didi and Zomato, there is currently no public market for any of these securities, and there may be no market in the future if and when we decide to sell such assets. Furthermore, we may be required to sell these assets at a time at which we would not be able to realize what we believe to be the long-term value of these assets. For example, if we were deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), we may be required to sell some or all of such assets so that we would not be subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act. Additionally, we may have to pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of these assets.

As a result of this concentration, our\noperating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and from\nairports. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior has changed and airline travel has slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to and\nfrom airports. Sustained declines in air travel due to COVID-19, or other travel-related health concerns, could continue to suppress demand for airport-related\nMobility and reduce our Mobility Gross Bookings from airport trips. Certain airports currently regulate ridesharing within airport boundaries, including by\nmandating that ridesharing service providers obtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have banned\nridesharing operations altogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking the\nrequisite permits. Such actions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, against\nus or Drivers. Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt our\noperations. In addition, if drop-offs or pick-ups of riders become inconvenient because of airport rules or regulations, or more expensive because of airport-\nimposed fees, the number of Drivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.

As a result of this concentration, our operating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and from airports. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior has changed and airline travel has slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to and from airports. Sustained declines in air travel due to COVID-19, or other travel-related health concerns, could continue to suppress demand for airport-related Mobility and reduce our Mobility Gross Bookings from airport trips. Certain airports currently regulate ridesharing within airport boundaries, including by mandating that ridesharing service providers obtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have banned ridesharing operations altogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking the requisite permits. Such actions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, against us or Drivers. Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt our operations. In addition, if drop-offs or pick-ups of riders become inconvenient because of airport rules or regulations, or more expensive because of airport-imposed fees, the number of Drivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. While we have entered into agreements with most major U.S. airports as well as certain airports outside the United States to allow the use of our platform within airport boundaries, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and we may not be successful in negotiating similar agreements with airports in all jurisdictions.\n\nIf we fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform or fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or if such technologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those offered by our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted.\n\nWe have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform. For example, in January 2021, we completed the merger of our autonomous technologies business with Aurora, and included a $400 million investment in the combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to which we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-driving vehicles on our ridesharing network.

The loss of qualified executives and employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate high-quality executives and employees required for the planned expansion of our business, may harm our operating results and impair our ability to grow.\n\nIn addition, we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi. We have entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Khosrowshahi, which is at-will and has no specific duration. Recently hired executives may view our business differently than members of our prior management team and, over time, may make changes to our personnel and their responsibilities as well as our strategic focus, operations, or business plans. We may not be able to properly manage any such shift in focus, and any changes to our business may ultimately prove unsuccessful.\n\nIn addition, our failure to put in place adequate succession plans for senior and key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transition into new roles, for example, as a result of reductions in workforce, organizational changes and attrition, could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. The unexpected or abrupt departure of one or more of our key personnel and the failure to effectively transfer knowledge and effect smooth key personnel transitions has had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business resulting from the loss of such person\u2019s skills, knowledge of our business, and years of industry experience. If we cannot effectively manage leadership transitions and management changes in the future, our reputation and future business prospects could be adversely affected.\n\nTo attract and retain key personnel, we use equity incentives, among other measures.

We have been subject to security and privacy incidents in the past and may be again in the future. For example, in May 2014, we experienced a data security incident in which an outside actor gained access to certain personal information belonging to Drivers through an access key written into code that an employee had unintentionally posted publicly on a code-sharing website used by software developers (the \u201c2014 Breach\u201d). In October and November of 2016, outside actors downloaded the personal data of approximately 57 million Drivers and consumers worldwide (the \u201c2016 Breach\u201d).

If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security incidents, or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. In addition, in July 2020, Drizly publicly disclosed that it had been subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal information of customers on its platform, and in November 2021 Drizly obtained final court approval of a settlement in a resulting class action litigation.

To continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform, we will need to continue to invest in the development of new products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers and that differentiate us from our competitors. For example, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about rider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to further strengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.\n\nDeveloping and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and features depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features.

We are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry (\u201cPCI\u201d) and Data Security Standard (the \u201cStandard\u201d). The Standard is a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security developed by the PCI Security Standards Council to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures. Our failure to comply with the Standard and other network operating rules could result in fines or restrictions on our ability to accept payment cards. Under certain circumstances specified in the payment card network rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, or other assessments of our compliance with the Standard. Such activities may reveal that we have failed to comply with the Standard. If an audit, self-assessment, or other test determines that we need to take steps to remediate any deficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time consuming remediation efforts. In addition, even if we comply with the Standard, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach. Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. In addition to violations of network rules, including the Standard, any failure to maintain good relationships with the payment card networks could impact our ability to receive incentives from them, could increase our costs, or could otherwise harm our business. The loss of our credit card acceptance privileges for any one of these reasons, or the significant modification of the terms under which we obtain credit card acceptance privileges, may have an adverse effect on our business, revenue, and operating results.\n\nCyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spamming, and phishing attacks could harm our reputation,", "bBox": {"x": 17, "y": 69, "w": 562.25, "h": 481.56}}], "status": "OK", "links": [], "width": 612, "height": 792, "triggeredAutoMode": false, "structuredData": null, "noStructuredContent": false, "noTextContent": false}, {"page": 69, "text": "business, and operating results.\n      We rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations.

Our business and operating results may be harmed if current and potential Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers believe\nour platform is unreliable. In addition, if we are unable to scale our data storage and computational capacity sufficiently or on commercially reasonable terms, our\nability to innovate and introduce new products on our platform may be delayed or compromised, which would have an adverse effect on our growth and business.\nOur use of third-party open source software could adversely affect our ability to offer our products and offerings and subjects us to possible litigation.\n      We use third-party open source software in connection with the development of our platform. From time to time, companies that use third-party open source\nsoftware have faced claims challenging the use of such open source software and their compliance with the terms of the applicable open source license. We may be\nsubject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software, or claiming non-compliance with the applicable open source licensing\nterms. Some open source licenses require end-users who distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open source software to\nmake available all or part of such software, which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code. While we employ practices designed to monitor\nour compliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we have not run a complete open source\nlicense review and may inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the applicable terms of\nsuch license, including claims for infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of open-source\nsoftware license types, almost none of which have been tested in a court of law, resulting in a dearth of guidance regarding the proper legal interpretation of such\nlicenses. If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the terms of any of our open source licenses, we may be required to publicly release certain portions\nof our proprietary source code or expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.\n      In addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software because open-\nsource licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the functionality or origin of the software. Use of open source software may also present\nadditional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our\nplatform. Additionally, because any software source code that we make available under an open source license or that we contribute to existing open source projects\nbecomes publicly available, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely, and we would be\nunable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code. Any of the foregoing could be harmful to our business, financial\ncondition, or operating results and could help our competitors develop products and offerings that are similar to or better than ours.\nFinancing and Transactional Risks\nWe will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\n      To continue to effectively compete, we will require additional funds to support the growth of our business and allow us to invest in new products, offerings,\nand markets.

We may expend significant cash or incur substantial debt to finance such acquisitions, and such indebtedness may restrict our business or require the use of available cash to make interest and principal payments. In addition, we may finance or otherwise complete acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, which may result in dilution to our stockholders, or if such convertible debt securities are not converted, significant cash outlays. If we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions or other strategic transactions successfully or fail to successfully address any of these risks, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be harmed.\n\nIn addition, any businesses we acquire may not perform as well as we expect. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies, including managing internal controls and any privacy or data security risks associated with such acquisitions, may harm our operating results and expansion prospects. For example, Careem has historically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We have maintained our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem\u2019s business, and doing so may cause our relationships with government authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem\u2019s app on either a temporary or indefinite basis.\n\nThe process of integrating an acquired company, business, or technology or acquired personnel into our company is subject to various risks and challenges, including:\n\n- diverting management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration;\n- disrupting our ongoing business operations;\n- platform user acceptance of the acquired company\u2019s offerings;\n- implementing or remediating the controls, procedures, and policies of the acquired company;\n- integrating the acquired business onto our systems and ensuring the acquired business meets our financial reporting requirements and timelines;\n- retaining and integrating acquired employees, including aligning incentives between acquired employees and existing employees, managing cultural differences between acquired businesses and our business, as well as managing costs associated with eliminating redundancies or transferring employees on acceptable terms with minimal business disruption;\n- maintaining important business relationships and contracts of the acquired business;\n- integrating the brand identity of an acquired company with our own;\n- integrating companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience;\n- liability for pre-acquisition activities of the acquired company;\n- litigation or other claims or liabilities arising in connection with the acquisition or the acquired company; and\n- impairment charges associated with goodwill, long-lived assets, investments, and other acquired intangible assets.\n\nWe have in the past and may in the future implement integration structures that do not fully integrate an acquired company\u2019s operating functions. For example, with respect to the integration of Careem and Drizly, each company\u2019s brand, product app(s) and payments apps continue to operate in parallel with Uber\u2019s apps and each company\u2019s engineering, human resources, and operations teams will continue to operate independently and report to such company\u2019s own Chief Executive Officer. Such structures may delay the efficiencies that we expect to gain from the acquisition and our brand and reputation could be impacted by any damage or reputational harm to the acquired company\u2019s brand.\n\nIn addition, our acquisition of Careem has increased our risks under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other similar laws outside the United States. Our existing and planned safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage corrupt practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible.\n\nWe may not receive a favorable return on investment for prior or future business combinations, and we cannot predict whether", "images": [], "charts": [], "items": [{"type": "text", "value": "form joint ventures, divest portions or aspects of our business, sell minority stakes in portions or aspects of our business, and acquire complementary companies or technologies, including our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, our joint venture with an affiliate of SK Telecom Co., Ltd., and our acquisitions of Careem, Cornershop, Postmates, Drizly and Transplace.

Any of these factors may adversely affect our ability to consummate a transaction, our financial condition, and our operating results.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business\nWe may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify our\nbusiness model in those jurisdictions as a result.\n      In certain jurisdictions, including expansion markets such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, our ridesharing business model has\nbeen blocked, capped, or suspended, or we have been required to change our business model, due primarily to laws and significant regulatory restrictions in such\njurisdictions. In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses or permits to operate and must continue to comply with the license or permit requirements\nor risk revocation. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. We cannot predict whether future regulatory decisions or\nlegislation in other jurisdictions may embolden or encourage other authorities to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an\nexisting license or permit.\n      Traditional taxicab and car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require us\nto comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject. For example, in January\n2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could be\npicked up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission\nimplemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in\nNew York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations\nhave had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Council\nvoted to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hire\nvehicle licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform, while the city studies whether a permanent freeze would help reduce congestion. In\nAugust 2019, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new \u201ccruising\ncap,\u201d intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business district of New York City.\nAlthough such \u201ccruising cap\u201d was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, in\nNovember 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effect\non January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago. In\naddition, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January\n1, 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to\nnegotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted in\ncountries outside the United States. If other jurisdictions impose similar regulations, our business growth could be adversely affected.\n      In certain jurisdictions, we are subject to national, state, local, or municipal laws and regulations that are ambiguous in their application or enforcement or that\nwe believe are invalid or inapplicable. In such jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory fines and proceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to cease\noperations altogether if we continue to operate our business as currently conducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that our\nbusiness operations are fully compliant. For example, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers who used\nthe Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hire Car Permit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance. We are considering further legal\nchallenges and possible policy solutions. However, these developments may adversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact our\nfinancial performance in Hong Kong. As another example, in January 2020, we ceased offering our Mobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruled\nthat we violated local competition laws. In response, we appealed the decision, made certain changes to our Mobility products in Colombia and re-launched\nMobility in Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia. Furthermore, in\ncertain of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products and\nofferings or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these laws and regulations. Our decision to\ncontinue operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject to scrutiny by government authorities. Our continuation of this\npractice and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and Drivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that our\nlicenses or permits that are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed. Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the future\ncontinue to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform.

These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations have had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Council voted to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hire vehicle licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform, while the city studies whether a permanent freeze would help reduce congestion. In August 2019, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new \u201ccruising cap,\u201d intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business district of New York City. Although such \u201ccruising cap\u201d was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago. In addition, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January 1, 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted in countries outside the United States. If other jurisdictions impose similar regulations, our business growth could be adversely affected.\n\nIn certain jurisdictions, we are subject to national, state, local, or municipal laws and regulations that are ambiguous in their application or enforcement or that we believe are invalid or inapplicable. In such jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory fines and proceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to cease operations altogether if we continue to operate our business as currently conducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that our business operations are fully compliant. For example, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers who used the Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hire Car Permit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance. We are considering further legal challenges and possible policy solutions. However, these developments may adversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact our financial performance in Hong Kong. As another example, in January 2020, we ceased offering our Mobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruled that we violated local competition laws. In response, we appealed the decision, made certain changes to our Mobility products in Colombia and re-launched Mobility in Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia. Furthermore, in certain of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products and offerings or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these laws and regulations. Our decision to continue operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject to scrutiny by government authorities. Our continuation of this practice and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and Drivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that our licenses or permits that are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed. Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the future continue to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform.

An increasing number of governments are enforcing\ncompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly\nsurrounding issues of pricing parity, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of\nanti-competitive conduct. For example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and India, alleging that our prices are too\nhigh (surge pricing) or too low (discounts or predatory pricing), or both.

Such rulings may alter the way in which we do business and,\ntherefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or\noperating results.\n      We expect that the U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies (e.g., the DOJ and the FTC) will continue to closely scrutinize merger activity, with a particular focus\non the technology sector, and there can be no assurance that proposed, completed or future mergers, acquisitions and divestitures will not be the subject of an\ninvestigation or enforcement action by the DOJ or the FTC. Changes in antitrust laws globally, or in their interpretation, administration or enforcement, may limit\nour future acquisitions, divestitures, operations and growth.\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.\n      Most jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain jurisdictions may determine that\ncertain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions. For example, our\nsubsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V., is registered and authorized by its competent authority, De Nederlandsche Bank, as an electronic money\ninstitution. This authorization permits Uber Payments B.V. to provide payment services (including acquiring and executing payment transactions and money\nremittances, as referred to in the Revised Payment Services Directive (2015/2366/EU)) and to issue electronic money in the Netherlands. In addition, Uber\nPayments B.V. has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other countries within the EEA. We\ncontinue to critically evaluate our options for seeking additional licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize our payment solutions and support\nthe future growth of our business. We could be denied such licenses, have existing licenses revoked, or be required to make significant changes to our business\noperations before being granted such licenses. If we are denied payment or other financial licenses or such licenses are revoked, we could be forced to cease or\nlimit business operations in certain jurisdictions, including in the EEA, and even if we are able to obtain such licenses, we could be subject to fines or other\nenforcement action, or stripped of such licenses, if we are found to violate the requirements of such licenses. In some countries, it is not clear whether we are\nrequired to be licensed as a payment services provider.

As another example, the California Public Utilities Commission (the \u201cCPUC\u201d) issued a proposed $59 million fine against us for not producing certain information, including personal information related to incidents disclosed in our 2019 US Safety Report. We negotiated the total payment to $9.15 million ($150,000 as a fine and $9 million to fund safety initiatives), which was approved by the CPUC in December 2021. Investigations and enforcement actions from such entities, as well as continued negative publicity and an erosion of current and prospective platform users\u2019 trust, could severely disrupt our business. In addition, in March 2022, Uber Technologies, Inc. and Uber BV were each fined \u20ac2.12 million by the Italian data protection authority for alleged privacy violations stemming from an investigation conducted in 2018.\n\nWe are also subject to inquiries and investigations by government agencies related to certain transactions we have entered into in the United States and other countries.\n\nThese government inquiries and investigations are time-consuming and require a great deal of financial resources and attention from us and our senior management. If any of these matters are resolved adversely to us, we may be subject to additional fines, penalties, and other sanctions, and could be forced to change our business practices substantially in the relevant jurisdictions. Any such determinations could also result in significant adverse publicity or additional reputational harm, and could result in or", "md": "increase in the frequency with which we make Driver payments without having received corresponding payments from consumers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\n\nIn addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our ability to provide payment processing on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all. For example, changes to our business in Europe, combined with changes to the EU Payment Services Directive, caused aspects of our payment operations in the EEA to fall within the scope of European payments regulation. As a result, one of our subsidiaries, Uber Payments B.V., is directly subject to financial services regulations (including those relating to anti-money laundering, terrorist financing, and sanctioned or prohibited persons) in the Netherlands and in other countries in the EEA where it conducts business. Effective July 1, 2020, we transitioned all our payment operations to the Uber Payments B.V. regulated entity in the EEA countries in which we are required to do so by the European payments regulations.\n\nIn addition, as we evolve our business or make changes to our business structure, we may be subject to additional laws or requirements related to money transmission, online payments, and financial regulation. These laws govern, among other things, money transmission, prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfers, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, banking, systemic integrity risk assessments, security of payment processes, and import and export restrictions. Our business operations, including our payments to Drivers and merchants, may not always comply with these financial laws and regulations. Historical or future non-compliance with these laws or regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, forfeiture of significant assets, or other enforcement actions. Costs associated with fines and enforcement actions, as well as reputational harm, changes in compliance requirements, or limits on our ability to expand our product offerings, could harm our business.\n\nFurther, our payment system is susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or services, and payments to sanctioned parties. We have invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable anti-money laundering and sanctions laws, and in the EEA to conduct appropriate risk assessments and implement appropriate controls as a regulated financial service provider. Government authorities may seek to bring legal action against us if our payment system is used for improper or illegal purposes or if our enterprise risk management or controls in the EEA are not adequately assessed, updated, or implemented, and any such action could result in financial or reputational harm to our business.\n\nWe currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General (\u201cAG\u201d) offices and other U.S. and foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business.\n\nWe are the subject of DOJ criminal and civil inquiries and investigations, as well as civil enforcement inquiries and investigations by other government agencies, including state AG offices in the United States and other regulators abroad. Those inquiries and investigations cover a broad range of matters, including our business practices, such as fees, pricing, and related disclosures, data privacy and security incidents, as well as data deletion and document retention policies related to the 2016 Breach, which involved the breach of certain archived consumer data hosted on a cloud-based service that outside actors accessed and downloaded. We have in the past and may in the future, settle claims related to such matters. For example, in September 2018, after investigations and various lawsuits relating to the 2016 Breach, we settled with the Attorneys General of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia through stipulated judgments and payment in an aggregate amount of $148 million related to our failure to report the incident for approximately one year. In April 2018, we entered into a consent decree that lasts through 2038 covering the 2014 Breach and the 2016 Breach with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d), which the FTC Commissioners approved in October 2018. In November and December 2018, UK, Dutch and French regulators imposed fines totaling approximately $1.6 million related to the 2016 Breach.

Such\nviolations subject us to individual or consumer class action litigation as well as governmental investigations and proceedings by federal, state, and local regulatory\nentities in the United States and internationally, resulting in exposure to material civil or criminal liability. Our data security and privacy practices have been the\nsubject of inquiries from government agencies and regulators, not all of which are finally resolved. In April 2018, we entered into an FTC consent decree pursuant\nto which we agreed, among other things, to implement a comprehensive privacy program, undergo biennial third-party assessments, and not misrepresent how we\nprotect consumer information through 2038.

In November and December 2018, UK, Dutch and French supervisory authorities imposed fines totaling approximately\n$1.6 million. We have also entered into settlement agreements with numerous state enforcement agencies. For example, in January 2016, we entered into a\nsettlement with the Office of the New York State Attorney General under which we agreed to enhance our data security practices. In addition, in September 2018,\nwe entered into stipulated judgments with the state attorneys general of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia relating to the 2016 Breach, which involved\npayment of $148 million and assurances that we would enhance our data security and privacy practices.

We may also assume liabilities for breaches experienced by the companies we acquire as we expand our operations. For example, in April\n2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain\npersonal information of riders and drivers on its platform as of January 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security\nincidents or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and\nsignificant liabilities. In addition, in July 2020, Drizly publicly disclosed that it had been subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal\ninformation of customers on its platform, and in November 2021 Drizly obtained final court approval of a settlement in a resulting class action litigation. If Drizly\nbecomes subject to additional liability or regulatory or court orders as a result of this or other data security incidents or if we fail to remediate this or any other data\nsecurity incident that Drizly or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. Our insurance programs may not\ncover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for the full extent of our potential liabilities.\n      This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions with stringent privacy laws and, as we expand our products, offerings, and operations domestically and\ninternationally, we have, and may continue to become subject to amended or additional laws that impose substantial additional obligations related to data privacy\nand security. The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements for\ncontrollers and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of\npersonal data, strengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special categories of\npersonal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data. The\nGDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) special\ncategories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated\nindividual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and\nharming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significant\npenalties, including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Other\njurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costs\nand the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which provides new privacy rights for consumers and\nnew operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of action\nagainst businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S.\nstates have adopted, and likely will continue to adopt, similar laws that provide new consumer privacy rights and business operational requirements.

In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness\nof our internal control over financial annually. We currently are required to disclose changes in internal control over financial reporting that have materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis.\n      The process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 is costly and\nchallenging, and we may not be able to complete evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion. As our business continues to grow in size\nand complexity, we are improving our processes and infrastructure to help ensure we can prepare financial reporting and disclosures within the timeline required\nfor a public company. During the evaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\n      We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, particularly due to high growth\nofferings (such as with Delivery and Freight), which may cause challenges in consistent performance and timely designing new controls. Any failure to maintain\ninternal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or operating results. If we are unable to\nconclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material\nweakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market\nprice of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC\nor other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain these and other\neffective control systems, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\n\nITEM 2.
