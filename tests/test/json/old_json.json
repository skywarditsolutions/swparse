Once the Novation Agreement is countersigned by CMS, all restrictions will be removed and privileges to the application will be elevated (Contact Type will be elevated from Transferee to APM Executive). Access to PHI will be restricted until a new HIPAA-Covered Data Disclosure Form is signed. Since the Novation Agreement is required to be countersigned before it is considered \"Active,\" the CMS Executive user will be required to complete the signature process. \n\n## 4I'S Agreement Signature Status Definitions\n\n| Signature   | Definitions                                                                |\n|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Status      |                                                                            |\n| Active      | This signature status describes agreements that have completed the         |\n|             | execution of its signature workflow.
